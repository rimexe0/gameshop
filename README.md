# Why ?

Teacher asked us to write a desktop application using python so i did using [customTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

## why both Tkinter and customTkiner ?

customTkinter didin't had some components i need so i imported both of them.

# install 

you need to install tkinter,customTkinter,pymysql and PIL.
